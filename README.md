This is my submission for Milestone project 2. The Watchtower site is a fun interactive site based in the DC comic 
universe. It provides information on characters from the comic book franchise, using HTML5, CSS3 and JS to pull

### Further testing ###
     

* Bugs:
     The navigation links do not render correctly on Iphone 5 screen:
     ![hero image screenshot](assets/images/screenshots/user_story_12.JPG)
     Resolved: No, Iphone 5 is now an old model and the navigation renders correctly on all Iphone models in
     the last 5 years. 
     Future fix may include a collapsable nav bar that lends itself to smaller screens.

* Changes from design:
Changes in design are detailed in the user story section above, key changes include:
User story 4 - change in functionality from multiple buttons to one button to reduce the clutter on the site.

User story 8 - Change from buttons to 'Flip' tiles to add nother dimension of interactivity to the site.

User story 9 - Included geocoder API in map and added custom data. This was to change the type of interaction with
the various maps on the site.

User story 11 - Enhanced functionality to provide link to external site and provide more information on 'villains'

User story 12 - Added functionality of contact form the email.js to increase interaction of the site.



* Potential enhancements:
The use of a collapsable nav bar (as detailed in the bugs section) would help with displaying navigation on
smaller screens.

The 'Find Our Heros' functionality sometimes repeats objects in the array, which lets down the UX of the site.
This means the user has to click several times to see the information for each hero. A potential fix for this would
be removing an object from the Array once it has been displayed, or, using the Fisher-Yates algorithm (suggested by
Code institute slack community Fisher-Yates ![https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle]) to prevent
repetition.
